Welcome to Cloak-And-Dagger!
Before you begin you'll need to hear us ramble about how to actually play this game.
Above you can see what the Goal, Enemy, and Player look like.
By the way, your characters name is Python! Pithy for short.
Tap and hold anywhere on the screen and your character will move to that location and will even navigate around walls and other obstacles!
Use the JoyStick on the screen to move the camera. Keep in mind you cannot move your character while doing this.
Avoid the Enemies and don't let them see or hear you!
You'll see a noise level at the top of the screen with a marker labeled LOUD!
If this bar fills up too high and you are too close to an enemy they will come to investigate...
Make it to the end of the level without being caught
If you get cought, the level restarts.
I think that is all you need to know, so get to escaping already!
